_Specifically, in 1990 the percentage of those aged 18-25 giving money to charity was 17%. In the same year the 26-35 age group had a much higher percentage (31%). However, by 2010, these figures had dropped: the former age group had a donation rate of only 7% and the latter around one quarter._

_In 1990, the highest proportion of donors could be seen in the 36-50 age group, at 42%. However, it fell by about 7 percentage points in 2010, standing behind the 51-65 age group who had a rate of 40%. Finally, in both years, around one third of those over 65 performed this charitable deed._
